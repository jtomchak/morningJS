## Function are Fun
[LINK](http://jsbin.com/xokoju/1/edit?js,console)

```js
//1. Here's a function that takes 2 arguments, it's pretty simple, it just adds them together for us. You need to call this function, passing it 11 and 10 and assign it to a variable called BlackJack. Then console log out that variable

function sum(num1, num2){
  return num1 + num2
};

//2. Cool, now I'd like you write a function called squared. It will take a single parameter, and return the squared value of the number passed to it. Then I'd like you to call it with the values 3 and then with 5, and colsole log out those too. 


//3. Stretch Goal. Now rewrite #2 in ES 2015 syntax. RAD!!!!!!
